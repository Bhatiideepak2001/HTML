          <dt><span>&#183;</span> Makar Sankranti</dt>

          <dd>
            A Hindu holiday known as Makar Sankranti commemorates the sun's
            entry into the Capricorn zodiac sign. It is observed in many regions
            of India and Nepal and often occurs on 14 or 15 January. The
            celebration commemorates the passage from the winter solstice to
            longer days. Taking a holy swim in rivers, particularly the Ganges,
            is a ritual associated with Makar Sankranti and is one of its
            important components. A dip during this time is thought to purify
            one of sins and bring good fortune. In various parts of India, kite
            flying is a common custom used to mark Makar Sankranti. There are
            frequently kite-flying competitions, and the sky is awash in vibrant
            kites. The event is a time for giving gratitude for the harvest,
            taking part in cultural activities with loved ones, and celebrating
            the solar calendar's transition. It is marked by a variety of
            regional customs and traditions and has significant cultural
            significance.

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Holi</dt>

          <dd>
            The "Festival of Colours," also known as Holi, is one of India's
            most colourful and popular holidays. It heralds the approach of
            spring and is joyfully and enthusiastically observed. The Hindu
            lunar calendar determines the date of Holi, which typically occurs
            in March. Playing with colours is the most recognisable part of
            Holi. People congregate in open areas and engage in colour-related
            games, tossing coloured powder and water balloons at one another.
            It's a happy and jubilant festival that dismantles social barriers
            and spreads joy. Although the colourful celebrations are its most
            well-known feature, Holi is also observed in a variety of
            traditional ways throughout India. It includes procession dances,
            local traditions, and other things in some regions.

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Rama Navami</dt>

          <dd>
            The Hindu holiday of Rama Navami commemorates the birth of Lord
            Rama, who is regarded as Lord Vishnu's seventh incarnation.
            According to the Hindu calendar, it occurs on the ninth day
            (Navami), which normally falls in March or April. At temples devoted
            to Lord Rama, devotees keep fasts and take part in prayers and pujas
            (rituals). It is customary to recite the Ramayana, an epic that
            describes the life and deeds of Rama. To commemorate Rama Navami,
            processions are planned in several areas. In opulent processions,
            idols or pictures of Lord Rama, his wife Sita, his devoted follower
            Hanuman, and other characters from the Ramayana are paraded.
          </dd>

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Raksha Bandhan</dt>

          <dd>
            A Hindu holiday termed Raksha Bandhan honours the relationship
            between siblings. The main ritual entails the sister wrapping a
            decorative thread known as a rakhi around her brother's wrist to
            represent her love and prayers for his wellbeing. The brother often
            promises to look out for and support his sister in exchange for a
            present. It's a day to celebrate sibling bonds and show affection
            for them. The Hindu lunar calendar month of Shravana is when Raksha
            Bandhan is traditionally observed. August is usually when this
            happens.
          </dd>

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Maha Shivratri</dt>

          <dd>
            Hindus celebrate Maha Shivaratri, also known as the "Great Night of
            Shiva," as a day to honour Lord Shiva. In the Hindu month of
            Phalguna, which often falls in February or March on the Gregorian
            calendar, it is marked on the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight.
            To the Shiva Linga, which represents Lord Shiva, devotees offer
            milk, fruits, flowers, and bael leaves. On Maha Shivaratri, many
            devotees practise fast as a form of penance and to enlist Lord
            Shiva's blessings. While some people choose to fast completely
            without eating or drinking, others may choose to only fast somewhat.
            Throughout India and other areas of the world, millions of devotees
            celebrate Maha Shivaratri with great enthusiasm.

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Janmashtami</dt>

          <dd>
            The birth of Lord Krishna, who is regarded as the eighth avatar of
            Lord Vishnu, is commemorated on Janmashtami, another colourful Hindu
            festival. It normally occurs on Ashtami, the eighth day of the
            Krishna Paksha, or dark fortnight, in the month of Shravana, or
            August or September. To honour the birth of Lord Krishna, devotees
            observe fasts, recite pious hymns, and take part in several cultural
            and religious celebrations. One of the highlights of Janmashtami is
            "Dahi Handi," in which groups of young people construct human
            pyramids to smash a pot of butter or curd. This tradition represents
            the mischievous side of Lord Krishna, who was reputed to have stolen
            butter as a youngster. India as a whole celebrates the occasion with
            great excitement and enthusiasm.
          </dd>

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Diwali</dt>

          <dd>
            Deepavali, usually referred to as Diwali, is one of the most
            frequently observed festivals among Hindus in India and around the
            world. The Gregorian calendar typically places it between October
            and November. It commemorates the triumph of good over evil and
            light over darkness. The major day of Diwali is on the third day of
            the celebration, which lasts for five days. To represent the victory
            of light over darkness, people decorate and clean their homes, light
            oil lamps (diyas), and light fireworks. Families get together, share
            holiday dinners, and exchange gifts. Diwali is notable for many
            reasons, one of which is the worship of various deities according to
            local customs. It honours the homecoming of Lord Rama, his wife
            Sita, and his devoted friend Hanuman to Ayodhya following their
            victory over the demonic king Ravana in North India.

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Navratri</dt>

          <dd>
            Navratri, meaning 'nine nights', begins the day after the new moon
            (Amavasya). The first nine days of the lunar cycle are considered
            feminine, representing Devi, the feminine aspect of the Divine. The
            ninth day, known as Navami, marks the end of this phase. The
            one-and-a-half days around the full moon are neutral, while the
            remaining eighteen days are masculine in nature. Traditionally, all
            worship up to Navami is dedicated to Devi during this feminine
            phase. There are twelve such nine-day periods each year, each
            focusing on a different aspect of the feminine Divine,or Devi. The
            Navratri that occurs in October is the most significant, as it is
            dedicated to Sharada, thegoddess of learning. This tradition places
            the highest value on learning, a unique ability that
            distinguisheshumans from other creatures. While other beings may be
            faster or stronger, they cannot learn as humans do

          <dt> <span>&#183;</span> Hanuman Jayanti</dt>

          <dd>
            Hanuman Jayanti, also known as Hanuman Janmotsav, will be celebrated
            on April 23, 2024. Lord Hanuman, one of the Ashta Chiranjeevis, was
            born on Purnima tithi in the month of Chaitra. Devotees across the
            country eagerly anticipate this auspicious occasion, celebrating it
            with utmost devotion and fervor.
          </dd>

          <dt><span>&#183;</span> Dussehra</dt>

          <dd>
            Dussehra is primarily the celebration of victory of Hindu God Rama
            over demon Ravana, the king of Lanka. The day is observed with
            country-wide processions carrying statues of Durga, Saraswati,
            Ganesha, Lakshmi, and more to nearby rivers or oceans and immersing
            them. Also, effigies of Ravana are burned symbolizing the victory of
            good over evil and celebrations are held by lighting fireworks.
            Also, Diwali or Deepavali festival preparations are started. Every
            year, the festival of Dussehra is celebrated with great enthusiasm
            and zeal. People across the country take part in the occasion in
            their unique style. It is the day when ten-headed Ravana was killed
            by Lord Rama. Vijayadashami is an auspicious festival in Hinduism
            and celebrates the triumph of good over evil. Every locality of the
            country has its own uniqueness in the celebrations.
