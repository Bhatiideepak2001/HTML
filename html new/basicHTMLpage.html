They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators.Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.</p>

    <h2>POLLUTION</h2>
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light). Pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants.

    Although environmental pollution can be caused by natural events, the word pollution generally implies that thecontaminants have an anthropogenic source â€“ that is, a source created by human activities, such as manufacturing,extractive industries, poor waste management, transportation or agriculture. Pollution is often classed as pointsource (coming from a highly concentrated specific site, such as a factory, mine, construction site), or nonpointsource pollution (coming from a widespread distributed sources, such as microplastics or agricultural runoff).</p>
